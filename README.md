## Integrations to aid adoption/use of Solid

To improve access to Pod data we need to have a concerted effort to build and maintain applications that make Solid available in locations where people typically integrate their drives.
It might be worth looking into market research to see what the most popularly used integrations of e.g. for GDrive are, and use those first.
 - A MacOS app to make your Solid storage available as a location on your machine - similar to this one for [Onedrive](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/onedrive/id823766827?mt=12)
 - Implement Solid with the [Model Context Protocol](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol) to enable the claude model to access data in your Pod.
 - Maintain this VScode extension for accessing Solid: https://github.com/jeswr/vscode-extension-solidfs
